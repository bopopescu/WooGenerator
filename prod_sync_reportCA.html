Each important field is represented by two colums, '<field>' and 'Delta <field>'.Each Delta field shows the value that this field had held previously, and the field without the delta prefix shows the new value for the field.These are the most important changes to check. You should look to make sure that the value in the the field without the delta is correct and that the value in the delta field is incorrect. </p><h3>Syncing Results</h3><p class="description "><strong></strong>Each of the items in these reports has the following sections:</p><p class="description "><strong>Update Name</strong> - The primary keys of the records being synchronized (rowcount and Wordpress ID) which should be unique for any matched records.</p><p class="description "><strong>OLD</strong> - The gdrive-test and woocommerce-test records before the sync.</p><p class="description "><strong>INFO</strong> - Mostly information about mod times for debugging.</p><p class="description "><strong>PROBLEMATIC CHANGES</strong> - instances where an important field has been changed. Important fields can be configured in coldata.py by changing the 'static' property.</p><p class="description "><strong>CHANGES</strong> - all changes including problematic.</p><p class="description "><strong>NEW</strong> - the end result of all changed records aftersyncing</p></p></div></div>
